<h1>Activity 1.2</h1>
<p>1.   Act out being a computer:  Play a game where your class acts out being a computer. One student acts as the Keyboard. The teacher uses the keyboard to give the computer a task to do or a problem to solve. Another student acts as the CPU and solves the problem. The CPU tells the answer to the student who is acting as the Monitor, who then shows the answer. Some students can also act as the wires that connect the Keyboard to the CPU and the CPU to the Monitor. You may include a couple of students as Speakers who will sing for the class! You can have your class take turns being different parts of a computer.</p>
<p>2.   Draw and colour a computer:  Draw a picture of the computer that you are using. Be sure to include all of the computer-related items on the desk in front of you. After your drawing is complete, colour it and write the names of the different parts.</p>
<p>3. Play games that require use of computer parts:<br />Request the teacher to open GCompris.<br />Click Applications=&gt;Games=&gt;Educational suite GCompris.</p>
