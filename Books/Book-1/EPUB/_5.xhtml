<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This book is meant to be used for teaching computers to children in a way that is mostly fun (as indicated by the “Masti” in the title). The teacher’s role is primarily that of a facilitator encouraging active learning. Specific guidelines for each lesson can be found in the Teacher’s Corner of each lesson. Ensure that the conceptual understanding is mastered before proceeding to the skills. Allow students to play educational computer games included in each lesson in order to reinforce learning of the concepts/skills covered in the lesson. In the computer lab, if they are doing activities in groups, ensure that they switch “drivers” frequently, so that each student gets to do a fair amount of the computer based activities. The Worksheets include exercises to inculcate higher order thinking skills. Use the Group Activities and Projects to stimulate creativity and knowledge sharing. The book is designed so that it can be covered comfortably in one year, with one class (30 to 45 minutes) per week. See the table below for an overview of the concepts, skills and values covered in each lesson along with a week wise schedule.</p>
