<td style="width: 47.255%;">
<p><span style="color: #0078be;">Jyoti [pointing to the music file icon]: This is similar to Paint files. There is one file for each song.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #0078be;">Moz: Very good. Now you know that we should not disturb others by playing loud music. Can you please reduce the volume?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0078be;">Jyoti [clicks on some button]: Oh! The song has stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0078be;">Moz: The song stopped as you clicked the <strong>Pause</strong> button. If you move the mouse pointer over the buttons, it will show the name of the button. Now start the song again.<img src="Image_589.png" /></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0078be;">Jyoti [clicks the Play button]: <img src="Image_590.png" alt="" width="57" height="55" />The music is playing from where it stopped!</span><br /><span style="color: #0078be;">Moz: Yes. When you Pause a song and then press <strong>Play</strong>, it will continue playing from where it had stopped. Now find the Volume button.</span><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Jyoti clicks the Volume button and tries to reduce the sound. But nothing happens. Tejas also tries but is not able to reduce the sound.<img src="g7130.png" alt="" width="49" height="53" /></span><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Moz: Do you see <img src="g2872.png" alt="" width="66" height="36" />this slider next to the Volume button? You can <img src="g2548.png" alt="" width="85" height="27" /> increase or decrease <img src="g2506.png" alt="" width="82" height="29" />the volume by moving this slider. To move the slider, first point the mouse on it. Then keep the left button of the mouse pressed and drag it. The trick is to keep the mouse button pressed while dragging.</span><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Tejas [dragging the slider up and down]:<img src="g2632.png" alt="" width="52" height="61" />Hey, this is fun! Can we play a different song now?</span><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Moz: Do you remember what you did in Paint to open a picture? I told you that you will find the same actions in other activities too! After you have studied this lesson,</span><br /><span style="color: #0078be;"> you will be able to:</span><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Tejas: Yes! I can use the <strong>Open</strong> option.</span><br/>
<span style="color: #000000;">He searches the toolbar of the music player till he finds the <strong>Open</strong> option.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;"> Tejas and Jyoti explore the controls and listen to more music.</span><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Moz: You may have different music players on your computer, but they will have similar buttons.</span><br/>
<span style="color: #000000;">▪ Play starts the song.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;"> ▪ Stop stops the song completely.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;"> ▪ Pause stops the song. Pressing Pause or Play again will continue the song from where it had stopped.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;"> ▪ Rewind and Forward to jump to a different part of the song or a different song.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;"> ▪ Slider can be used to increase or decreasethe volume.</span><br /><span style="color: #000000;"> ▪ Mute turns off the volume when it is pressed. The song continues to play, but you cannot hear it. Pressing Mute again will turn the volume back on.</span><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Jyoti: Moz, I see a very small music player window at the bottom of the screen. When I click on it, the big music player window disappears. When I click on it again, the big window is back again. What is happening?</span><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Moz: The bar at the bottom of the screen is called the <strong>Taskbar</strong>. When you open any activity, a small window of that activity appears on the Taskbar. Tomorrow you can learn more about the Taskbar and windows. Chin Chinaki…</span><br/>
