<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Parts of Computers</span></h1>
<h2>In this lesson you will learn about the main parts of a computer.</h2>
<p>Tejas and Jyoti were in the computer room, looking at one of the computers. They were trying to see how the wires were connected together, when Moz appeared…</p>
<p><span>Moz: So, have you already noticed that a computer has many parts?</span><br /><span>Tejas: Yes, just like we have hands, legs, eyes and ears! What are the names for the parts of a computer?</span></p>
<p><span>Moz: The names of the four most important parts are – CPU, Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse.</span></p>
<p><span>Jyoti: Why does a computer need so many parts? What do they do? How </span><span>are they connected?</span></p>
<p><img src="19-2.png" alt="" width="602" height="323" /></p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Moz: Good questions! Let us learn about each of these parts.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>CPU</strong></span></h2>
<p><img src="Image_384.png" /></p>
<p>CPU (central processing unit) is the most important part of a computer. It is like the brain. It does all the tasks that we want the computer to do. It also controls all the other parts, like the Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse. These parts have to be connected to the CPU, for them to work.</p>
<p></p>

<h2><span style="color: #993366;">Monitor</span></h2>
<p></p>
<p><img src="Image_385.png" width="165" height="203" alt="" /><br style="clear: both;" />A monitor looks like a TV screen.  The CPU uses the monitor to show us photos, movies and games. The front portion of the monitor is called the screen, or display.</p>
<p></p>

<h2><span style="color: #993366;">Keyboard</span></h2>
<p><img src="Image_386.png" width="314" height="160" alt="" /></p>
<p>The keyboard is made of several small buttons called keys. Each key has a number, letter or word written on it. Just as you use a pencil to write on a paper, you can use a keyboard to write with a computer.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #800080;">Mouse</span></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #800080;"><img src="Image_388.png" width="126" height="142" alt="" /></span></h2>
<p class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element  vc_custom_1507629950024">A mouse is used to point at items shown on the monitor. The mouse usually has two or three buttons and a small wheel between the buttons.</p>

<p><span>Tejas: You said that we can draw pictures using the computer. Can I</span><span> </span><span>use a mouse for drawing? How can I take the picture home?</span><br /><span>Moz: Yes! You can use the mouse to draw pictures. But, you need a </span><span>Printer to print your picture and take it home.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="Image_389.png" width="277" height="181" alt="" /></span></p>

<p><span>Jyoti: You said that we can listen to songs on the computer. From which of these parts do we hear the song?</span></p>

<div class="vc_column-inner ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper"><img src="Image_390.png" width="190" height="142" alt="" /></div>
</div>

<p><span>Moz:  Not from any of these parts. We need Speakers to listen to songs. Remember, the </span><span>speakers, printer or any other part will work only if they are connected to the CPU.</span><br />Tejas picks up the computer mouse and starts playing with it.</p>

<p><span>Tejas: What are these buttons for?</span><br /><span>Moz: Be careful! We must take proper care of the different computer parts. </span><span>Tomorrow we will learn how to do this and then we will learn about the buttons.</span><br /><span>Chin Chinaki…</span></p>
