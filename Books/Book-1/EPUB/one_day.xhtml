<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">One day...</span></h1>
<p>When Tejas and Jyoti were playing in their school ground, their ball rolled into the computer room. Tejas and Jyoti usually stayed back after school, while waiting to go home. They enjoyed this time,as they had the entire school to themselves. The school allowed children to use the library, playground, and other facilitied during their free time.</p>
<p>So far, Tejas and Jyoti had not been inside the computer room. Today they meekly went in, to search for their ball. To their surprise, they saw a big mouse holding their ball! The mouse was wearing glasses, which were sliding down its nose. It was afunny sight. Tejas and Jyoti became curious. They stretched their hands to take the ball. The mouse moved back playfully and was not frightened of the children at all. </p>

<p>Tejas and Jyoti were distracted by the colourful screens on the computers in the room. They went near one of the computer to have a closer look. Suddenly they heard a voice from a top the computer “Would you like to learn about computers?” The children looked up and saw it was the mouse. They were excited to hear the mouse speak. They wanted to be freiends with this mouse.</p>
<p><br /><span style="color: #087596;">Tejas: I am Tejas, I am 6 years old.</span><br /><span style="color: #087596;">Jyoti: I am Jyoti. I am in First Standard. What is your name? How old are you?</span><br /><span style="color: #087596;">Mouse: My name is Moz. I am very old.</span><br /><span style="color: #087596;">Tejas: Can we be friends?</span><br /><span style="color: #087596;">Moz: Yes. I will help you learn about computers and you teach me to play with this ball.</span><br /><span style="color: #087596;">Jyoti: Oh! This is going to be fun. Can we play games using computers?</span></p>
<p><br />But… it was time for them to go home. Before disappearing with the ball, Moz said, “<span style="color: #087596;">I will tell you when we meet again, tomorrow. Chin Chinaki!</span>”</p>
