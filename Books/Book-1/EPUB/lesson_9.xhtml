<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Exploring the Desktop</span></h1>
<p><img src="g13359.png" alt="" width="54" height="61" />In this lesson you will learn about the computer Desktop and elements of a window.<br/>
Jyoti and Tejas were exploring the computer and Moz walks in.<br />Moz: Hello children. So you are exploring the activities on the Desktop?<br />Jyoti: Yes. Why is this screen called the Desktop?<br/>
Moz: How do you arrange all your books on a desk? If all the books are neatly arranged, is it not easy to find them? In the same way, the screen where all the icons are arranged is called a Desktop. Icons of activities that we use often are kept on the Desktop. The bar at the bottom of the screen is called the Taskbar.<br/>

Jyoti double clicks on music icon and then the paint icon.<br /> <span style="color: #0078be;">Jyoti: Two windows have opened. So, can I play music and also paint?</span><br /><span style="color: #0078be;"> Moz: Yes. You can. You can start more than one activity on the computer.</span><br /><span style="color: #0078be;"> Each time you double click an icon, it opens a new <strong>Window</strong> for that activity.</span></p>

<td style="width: 59.3199%;">Tejas is watching the windows when Jyoti clicks on the Paint window.</td>

<p><span style="color: #0078be;">Tejas: Clicking on a window brings it to the front.</span><br /><span style="color: #0078be;"> Moz: Correct. Whenever you click on a Window, the computer brings it in front and allows you to use that activity.</span><br /> The top bar of a window is called the <strong>Title bar</strong>. You can recognize the activity in a window by the title on the title bar.<br/>
Tejas [Clicks the    <img src="Image_621.gif" alt="" width="27" height="28" />  button on the title bar of the Paint window]: The paint window has gone! How can I get it back?</p>
<table style="width: 100%;">

<tr>
<td style="width: 40.3898%;"><span style="color: #0078be;">Moz: You clicked the <strong>Minimise</strong> button. This button is at the top</span><br /><span style="color: #0078be;"> right corner and makes any window very small. See here on the Taskbar. The Paint activity window has become a small button. Clicking this Paint button on the Taskbar will open the Paint window again.</span></td>

</table>
<p><span style="color: #0078be;">The taskbar has one button for each window on the Desktop. So, all the activities that have been started can be seen in the taskbar.</span><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Jyoti [clicks the   <img src="Image_626.jpg" alt="" width="28" height="27" />   button on the music window]: The music window has gone! The music has also stopped. I clicked on ‘X’ at the top right corner of the window.</span><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Moz: Ah! You clicked the <strong>Close</strong> button. This ‘X’ at the top right corner of the window is used to close the activity. See here, it has gone from the taskbar also.</span><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Jyoti: The picture on Tejas’s desktop is different from mine. Can we change these pictures?</span><br /><span style="color: #0078be;"> Moz: Yes. You can. You can make the desktop look any way you like. The picture on the desktop is called the <strong>Wallpaper</strong>. A right click on the desktop brings up a dialog box. One of the options allows you to change the wallpaper.</span><br/>
<img src="Image_627.png" alt="" width="386" height="305" /><br/>
<span style="color: #0078be;">Tejas: That means we can also use our own paintings as wallpaper.</span><br /><span style="color: #0078be;"> Moz: Yes. You can add more wallpapers to the ones that are already there.</span><br /><span style="color: #0078be;"> Explore all the options in the dialog box at your home.</span><br /><span style="color: #0078be;"> Chin Chinaki…</span></p>
